# TurbinePred
Ma512 final project



  You have worked hard for several weeks to understand why and how neural networks work. Now you have an opportunity to apply this knowledge you have acquired to a new dataset.

 To read the dataset you need to execute the following command:

`data =pd.read_csv('/content/gdrive/MyDrive/Ma512/Project/Turbine_Data_project.csv')`

 This dataset contains the power generated by wind turbines *every 10 minutes*, the wind speed and the wind direction compared to the wind turbine. Your task is to use several neural networks to perform a prediction of the power generated by the wind turbine! You need to train a dense fully connected neural network and two different types of recurrent neural networks.

The wind speed is in column 0, named “WindSpeed”.
The wind direction is in column 1, named “WindDirection”.
The power generated is in column 2, named “Power”.

 You have to predict column 2 as a function of columns 0 and 1. You have to separate your data in a train set, a validation set and a test set and show how well your models perform on the test set.

 You will upload on Moodle an .ipynb file named Project_NAME1_NAME2_NAME3.ipynb for each group of 2 or 3 students with all your work and all your comments.



Good work!
